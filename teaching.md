## MIT

Teaching assistant for:

* 18.330 [Introduction to Numerical Analysis](http://homerreid.dyndns.org/teaching/18.330/), taught by Homer Reid. Spring 2015.

## PROMYS
I worked for the [PROMYS program](http://www.promys.org/) during the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013, twice as head counselor. The program leads high-school students to rediscover and prove a substantial amount of number theory in six weeks. I found it a formative experience as a student in 2007 and 2008, and would encourage anyone to get involved.
