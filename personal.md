## Identity

I'm transgender and queer; some more nuanced words that apply to me are non-binary (my gender isn't described by "man" or "woman"), genderqueer (I like bending gender norms and binaries), pansexual (I'm attracted to all genders), and polyamorous (I maintain clear, ethical intimate relationships with several people). I'm also white and able-bodied. I tend to use the pronouns [ze/hir/hirs](my.pronoun.is/ze/hir) in queer spaces, and [she/her/hers](my.pronoun.is/she/her) in the general public.

Mental illness is a part of my life: I have unipolar depression, anxiety with panic, and PTSD.

I welcome anyone with identity overlaps with me, as well as those questioning, to reach out to me and chat!


## Pursuits outside of math

I'm passionate about music, ranging from baroque classical, through classic rock, blues and funk, to alt metal. I play violin, viola, guitar, bass guitar, ukulele, and enjoy tinkering with any instrument I can get my hands on.

I engage in activism around queer & trans rights, mental healthcare reform, and work in solidarity with other marginalized groups.
