## Identity

I'm transgender and queer; some more nuanced words that apply to me are non-binary (my gender isn't fully described by "man" or "woman"), genderqueer (I incline towards bending gender norms and binaries), pansexual (I'm potentially attracted to all genders), and polyamorous (I maintain ethical intimate relationships with several people). I'm also white and able-bodied. I use the pronouns [ze/hir/hirs](http://my.pronoun.is/ze/hir) in queer spaces, and [she/her/hers](http://my.pronoun.is/she/her) in the general public.

Mental illness is a part of my life: I have unipolar depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

I welcome anyone with identity overlaps with me, as well as those questioning, to reach out to me and chat!


## Pursuits outside of math

I'm passionate about music, ranging from baroque classical, through classic rock, blues and funk, to alt metal. I play violin, viola, guitar, bass guitar, ukulele, and enjoy tinkering with any instrument I can get my hands on.

I engage in activism around queer & trans rights, mental healthcare reform, and work in solidarity with other marginalized groups.


## Family

I live with my primary partner [Daria Phoebe Brashear](https://dariaphoebe.com) with our cats [Nip](https://twitter.com/nipkitten) and [Tuck](https://twitter.com/tuckkitten); our life together revolves around fostering a sense of family in the trans community. Zie works in distributed file systems at [Auristor, Inc.](https://www.auristor.com) My other partners [Georgia](https://twitter.com/georgiasquyres) and Rox are both graduate students. My parents live in the greater Boston area, working in town planning and software. My sister [Nicola](https://electroceramics.mit.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=157) works in materials science at Kyushu University and MIT, and my sister [Caroline](https://otd.harvard.edu/about/team/caroline-perry) works in communications at Harvard.
