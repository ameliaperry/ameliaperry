## About

I am a second-year graduate student in the [MIT Department of Mathematics](http://math.mit.edu). I mainly study theoretical computer science, with [Jon Kelner](http://math.mit.edu/~kelner/) as my advisor. I'm fairly new to theoretical CS, but I'm gravitating toward [approximation algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm), relaxation hierarchies, and the [sum of squares method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-of-squares_optimization) as a direction of research. 

I spent my undergraduate years at [Keble College, Oxford](http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/), mainly thinking about algebraic topology. I still engage with computational aspects of the field; see my [software](/software/), hosted on [github](http://github.com/willperry).
