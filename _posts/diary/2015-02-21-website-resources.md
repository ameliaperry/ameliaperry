OK, this website is going live. Here are some of the resources & components involved:
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the overall content framework
* [Skinny Bones](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) for the theme
* [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com) for hosting (this is overkill, but I sometimes play with dynamic content)
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) for LaTeX rendering
* [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for Markdown rendering
* [This post](http://drz.ac/2013/01/03/blogging-with-math/) was helpful for getting the markdown & MathJax interaction all working.
