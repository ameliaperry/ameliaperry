I've spent most of today putting this website together. Here are some of the resources & components involved:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the overall content framework
- [Skinny Bones](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) for the theme
- [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com) for hosting (this is overkill, but I sometimes play with dynamic content)
- [Disqus](https://disqus.com) for comments
- [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) for LaTeX rendering
- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for Markdown rendering
- [Git](http://git-scm.com) for version control
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for git hosting
- [This post](http://drz.ac/2013/01/03/blogging-with-math/) was helpful for getting the markdown & MathJax interaction all working.

I'm still uncertain of what I'll use to edit posts long-term -- whether it'll be the usual `vim`. I tried [Qute](http://www.inkcode.net/qute) for a bit, which was a surprisingly nice experience, but too rough around the edges and development seems to have ceased.
