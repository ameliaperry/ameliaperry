Computations in the cobar complex for $BP_* BP$ or the Steenrod algebra.

Software to be uploaded soon. Maybe I'll experiment with compiling programs to Javascript, and see if I can run these calculators as a web application.

Meanwhile, some form of it is available at [Michael Andrews's website](http://math.mit.edu/~mjandr/).
